## Kev's IT Portfolio

This portfolio describes the home lab I designed and built to strengthen my practical skills in IT support, networking, and security.  I use a hypervisor on my own hardware to run multiple virtual machines, simulating a real-world small business environment.

Users connect through a firewall to internal services via a Windows 11 Jump box. This provides access to an Ubuntu Apache server running osTicket, a Windows server running Active Directory domain, and a full Security Onion monitoring stack. Each component was installed, configured, troubleshot, and documented by me to reflect real-world IT workflows and decision making.

## Lab Sections

## Network Topology (Physical and Logical)
This section documents the physical layout and logical segmentation of my home network, along with the VLANs, firewall, boundaries, and routing paths of my home lab.
