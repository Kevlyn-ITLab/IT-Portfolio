This portfolio describes the home lab I designed and built to strengthen my practical skills in IT support, networking, and security.  I use a hypervisor on my own hardware to run multiple virtual machines, simulating a real-world small business environment.
Users connect through a firewall to internal services via a Windows 11 Jump machine. This provides access to an Ubuntu Apache server running osTicket, a Windows server running Active Directory domain, and a full Security Onion monitoring stack. Each component was installed, configured, troubleshot, and documented by me to reflect real-world IT workflows and decision making.
